description: Learn how to interact with and manage documents using the Weav.ai platform. This guide covers uploading, retrieving, analyzing and more.
---

## **Overview**
The Documents section provides functionalities to upload, manage, and extract insights from documents on the Weav.ai platform. This guide walks you through key operations such as creating documents, retrieving metadata, downloading forms, generating summaries, and analyzing page-level data. These tools are designed to streamline document workflows and improve efficiency.

**Prerequisite** - To get started, ensure your environment is properly configured by following the [Setup Guide](setup).

-----
### Create document

Upload a document from your local system to the copilot. Has the ability to upload documents into a folder.

```bash
python3 documents/documents/create_document.py --file_path "AAPL_10Q.pdf"
```

**Parameters:**

| **Parameter** | **Description** | **Required/Optional** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| file_path | The file path to your document on your local system | Required |
| folder_id | The ID of the folder that should hold the document. If it is not provided, the file will be uploaded but will not be inside any folder. | Optional |

**Response:**

Upon uploading, the document response should be as follows.

```bash
{
   "ai_tags":[
      
   ],
   "category":"",
   "created_at":datetime.datetime(2024, 10, 3, 22, 14, 10, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)),
   "download_url":"/doc-proc-service/local_store/google-oauth2|117349365869611297391/66ff1732927ce8c0ebda42bd/66ff1732927ce8c0ebda42bd",
   "file_name":"AAPL_10Q.pdf",
   "form_instances":"None",
   "id":"66ff1732927ce8c0ebda42bd",
   "in_folders":[
      
   ],
   "media_type":"application/pdf",
   "pages":[
      
   ],
   "redacted_summary":"",
   "size":654929,
   "source":"application",
   "status":"NEW",
   "step_status":{
      "FORM_EXTRACTION":{
         "error":"",
         "modified_at":datetime.datetime(2024, 10, 3, 22, 14, 10, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)),
         "response":{
            
         },
         "status":"NOT_STARTED"
      }
   },
   "summary":"",
   "summary_status":"",
   "tags":[
      
   ],
   "tenant_id":"",
   "user_id":"google-oauth2|117349365869611297391"
}
```

After the document has been uploaded, it undergoes `process_document_sensors`  workflow which may take a while. 

Once the processing is completed, you will notice that some fields from before are updated using information extracted from the document using the `Get Document` API

---

### Get Document

Retrieve information about the uploaded document. Fields in this response might be empty initially but are completely filled once basic processing is completed

**Parameters:**

| **Parameter** | **Description** | **Required/Optional** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| document_id | The unique identifier of the document | Required |
| fill_pages | If false pages will be empty | Optional (default: False) |

### Download form instance

Allows the user to download the extracted form

```bash
python3 documents/documents/download_form_instance.py --download_format "JSON" --document_id "66ff1732927ce8c0ebda42bd"
```

**Parameters:**

| **Parameter** | **Description** | **Required/Optional** | **Allowed values** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| document_id | The unique identifier of the document | Required |  |
| download_format | The format in which the results need to be viewed | Optional (default : ‚ÄúJSON‚Äù) | JSON, CSV |

**Response:**

`--download_format = "JSON"`

```bash
{
   "doc_id":"66ff1732927ce8c0ebda42bd",
   "form_id":"66ff076db1d0dfb13c99760f",
   "new":[
      "0.00001",
      "1.375",

    ]
}
```

`--download_format = "CSV"`

```bash
                     doc_id                   form_id                                                new

```

<aside>
üí°

Downloading form instance can only be done once form processing has been completed and form definition has been created.

</aside>

<aside>
üí°

If form processing has not been run, you can run it by first [creating a form definition](https://www.notion.so/How-to-use-the-Developer-Scripts-10c5084286c5801bb388fbcc98dc5626?pvs=21) and using the [Run workflow](https://www.notion.so/How-to-use-the-Developer-Scripts-10c5084286c5801bb388fbcc98dc5626?pvs=21) script by passing `workflow_name` as `process_form_workflow`
